# Clustering for Customer Segmentation & Understanding

# üí° Problem Statement:

Not all customers are same. Knowing which group is your customer and their preferences is a big part of success in your business. Unsupervised machine learning can help marketers to know their audience globally and engage them with their products accordingly.
Here we can classify millions of people‚Äôs interests through their social media activity and also through other surveys online & offline and cluster them in specific groups of their interest.

## üìù Proposed Solution:

In the context of customer segmentation, customer clustering analysis is the use of a mathematical model to discover groups of similar customers based on finding the smallest variations among customers within each group. These homogeneous groups are known as "customer archetypes" or "personas".

The goal of cluster analysis in marketing is to accurately segment customers in order to achieve more effective customer marketing via personalization. A common cluster analysis method is a mathematical algorithm known as k-means cluster analysis, sometimes referred to as scientific segmentation. The clusters that result assist in better customer modelling and predictive analysis and are also used to target customers with offers and incentives personalized to their wants, needs, and preferences.

## ‚è≥ Data Description:

The sample dataset summarizes the usage behaviour of about 9,000 active credit cards.
Holders during the last 6 months. The file is at the customer level, with 18 behavioural variables.

## üõ†Tools used

Python programming language and frameworks such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupiter notebook, Git-Github, VScode, Stremlit are used to build the whole model.

‚Ä¢	The Python programming language used to build machine learning algorithms.

‚Ä¢	Pandas are chiefly used for machine learning in the form of DataFrames. Pandas allows for importing and exporting tabular data in various formats, such as CSV or JSON files.

‚Ä¢	NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

‚Ä¢	The sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modelling including classification, regression, and clustering and dimensionality reduction.

‚Ä¢	GitHub hosts a large collection of open-source machine-learning projects. A GitHub repository is the Git folder inside a project. This repository tracks all changes made to files in your project, building history over time.

‚Ä¢	Python Seaborn library is a widely popular data visualization library that is commonly used for data science and machine learning tasks.

Collecting data from User:

Here we will collect all data from user such as Variables of the Dataset, Balance, Balance Frequency, Purchases, One-off Purchases, Instalment Purchases, Cash Advance Purchases Frequency, One-off Purchases Frequency, Purchases Instalment Frequency, Cash Advance Frequency, Cash Advance, TRX Purchases, TRX Credit Limit, Payments, Minimum Payments, PRC, Full Payment, and Tenure Cluster.

After clicking the submit button, it will display which cluster the provided data belongs to in relation to the graph.
